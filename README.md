## Artificial Stupidity (人工無脳)
A project I worked on with a couple of my friends in my Cognitive Science class at KEIO University.  

## Objective
The objective of the project was to make a chat-bot that classmates would talk to at the end of the semester.  
There were several teams and the bot that could hold the conversation the longest with the largest audience would win the competition.  

## Result
Our team won the over all competition!  
In our project, we included many of the 'memes' that most people in our grade would understand and had many outrageous and inappropriate languages to keep students interested.
